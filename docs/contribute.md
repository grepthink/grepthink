# Setting up a development environment to contribute

## Step 1: Python Virtual Environment
Note: Python 3.6.0 is used. Check your python version with `python --version`

If you don't have [virtualenv](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) (it comes with python3 on some systems), install it with `pip install virtualenv`

Change to a directory where you want the teamwork-project directory to reside (e.g. `cd Documents/`)

Create a new venv (this will create a new folder with python installed and later django/dependencies)
```bash
$ virtualenv twdev
```
Note: you don't have to call your folder/venv "twdev"

Now cd into twdev (or whatever you named your venv) and activate it
```bash
$ source bin/activate
```

For windows: cd into twdev/Scripts and run activate.bat

Note: you'll have to activate the venv anytime you want to work on this project. Consider adding an alias to your .bash_profile or .bashrc
```bash
alias tw="cd ~/Documents/twdev && source bin/activate"
```
You can always exit the venv with `deactivate`

## Step 2: Cloning the Repo
Optionally fork the grepthink repo. Clone it into the venv folder you just created.

## Step 3: Make a .env file based on .env.example
The .env file should be in the twdev (or whatever you named your venv) folder. So above the teamwork-project folder.

This is so we can keep the secret key hidden.

It also allows us to use sqlite locally and postgres in production, neat.

For local develompent, your DATABASE_URL can be something like:
`DATABASE_URL=sqlite:////Users/sammyslug/Documents/twdev/grepthink/teamwork/db.sqlite3`

The .env file should be in /twdev/teamwork-project

:)

## Step 4: Install dependencies
This part is fun because it's easy. Make sure you're in your venv then install everything in requirements.txt
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Step 5: I think that's it
You can try running with `python manage.py runserver`
